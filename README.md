# Fluid Simulation
In this project I aim to implement various fluid simulation techniques. It is ongoing.

The file stable_fluid.py implements Stable Fluids by Jos Stam. The paper describes a general approach, referring to common existing ideas such as solving the diffusion equation implicitly.

Below is a screenshot of a simulation ran using this code:
